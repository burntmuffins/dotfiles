## My keybinds
### Keyboard
`Alt` `Shift` `R`    =  restart ctwm <br>
`Alt` `Shift` `Q`    =  quit ctwm <br>
`Alt` `Shift` `C`    =  close the current window

### Mouse
`Alt` `Left click`   =  move the current window <br>
`Alt` `Middle click` =  iconify/minimize the current window <br>
`Alt` `Right click`  =  raise the current window <br>
`Alt` `Right click` AND drag  =  resize the current window <br>

## Notes
Keep in mind that the fonts **might** look different on your system because my fonts are very borked.
